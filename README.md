## Getting Started

Run the completed project to understand what you're building

```sh
# Clone the project
git clone git@github.com:itsRealoj/legit-news-reader.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the project
npm run start

# Navigate to http://localhost:3000
```

To build your own from scratch, first initialize the project. Our solution uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Review the [Hacker New API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)
documentation. You will need the `/topstories` endpoint to get the list of the
story IDs and the `/item` endpoint to get the data for each story individually.
